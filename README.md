Chrome WeDo Helper
=============================

This Chrome App uses the built in HID and Socket Server APIs to communicate with Scratch 2.0 via a JavaScript extension. The main purpose of this app is to enable LEGO WeDo support in Scratch 2.0 on Google Chromebooks. This is also a viable Linux solution since Linux is not currently supported by the Scratch Browser Plugin.

This should work on all platforms starting with Chrome version 38.

Instructions
-------------------------------
1. Download the [LEGO WeDo Chrome.sb2](https://github.com/khanning/chrome-wedo-helper/blob/master/LEGO WeDo Chrome.sb2?raw=true) and [ChromeWeDoHelper.crx](https://github.com/khanning/chrome-wedo-helper/blob/master/ChromeWeDoHelper.crx?raw=true) files above
2. Open Google Chrome and go to ```Menu``` > ```More Tools``` > ```Extensions```
3. Drag and drop the ChromeWeDoHelper.crx file onto the Extensions window and accept the permission warning
4. Launch the ```Chrome WeDo Helper app```
5. Go to http://scratch.mit.edu and start a new project
6. Click ```File``` > ```Upload from your computer``` and choose the LEGO WeDo Chrome.sb2 you downloaded in Step 1
7. You should now be able to access the WeDo blocks under the ```More Blocks``` category
8. You can view the status of the Scratch 2.0 and WeDo connection in the ```Chrome WeDo Helper``` app window.
